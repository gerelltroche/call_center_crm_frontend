# Region CRM

## What is this for?

Avoid wasteful efforts in your marketing by assigning each user a Region. Each user can view, edit, complete, or cancel their Region and request more Regions. The admin panel will be updated with each operation by the user. In the admin panel, you can also view the current status of all Regions, revoke, assign or edit them.

## Use as Boilerplate

This code is a great starting point for a CRUD Web Application if you need basic login functionality and the ability to render lists of different types.
